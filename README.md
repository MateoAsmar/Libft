## **Description:**
 
Libft is my custom C library project from 42, where I re-implemented a variety of standard C functions as well as additional utilities. This project was a key step in mastering C programming, memory management, and understanding the inner workings of the standard library.


## **Features:**

### ***Standard Functions Re-Implemented:***

***Memory manipulation:*** ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, ft_memccpy, ft_memmove, ft_memcmp

***String functions:*** ft_strlen, ft_strdup, ft_strcpy, ft_strncpy, ft_strcat, ft_strncat, ft_strcmp, ft_strncmp, ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strstr, etc.

***Character checks and conversions:*** ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint, ft_toupper, ft_tolower


## **Requirements:**

***Compiler:*** gcc or any ANSI C compliant compiler

***Standard:*** C89/C90 (as specified by the 42 curriculum)

***Build Tool:*** make


## **Installation & Compilation:**

To compile the library, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This command compiles all source files and generates the static library libft.a.


## **Testing:**

The library has been thoroughly tested to ensure that each function behaves like its standard library counterpart. If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, please feel free to reach out.


## **Acknowledgments:**

This project was completed as part of the 42 curriculum. I would like to thank the 42 community and my mentors for their invaluable support and guidance.
